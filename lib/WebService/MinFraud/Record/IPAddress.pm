# ABSTRACT: Contains data for the IPAddress record returned from a minFraud web service query

__END__

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use 5.010;

  use WebService::MinFraud::Client;

  my $client = WebService::MinFraud::Client->new(
      account_id  => 42,
      license_key => 'abcdef123456',
  );
  my $request    = { device => { ip_address => '24.24.24.24' } };
  my $insights   = $client->insights($request);
  my $ip_address = $insights->ip_address;
  say $ip_address->city->name;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class contains the GeoIP2 location data returned from a minFraud service
query for the given C<ip_address>.

=head1 METHODS

This class provides the following methods:

=head2 city

Returns a L<GeoIP2::Record::City> object representing city data for the IP
address.

=head2 continent

Returns a L<GeoIP2::Record::Continent> object representing continent data for
the IP address.

=head2 country

Returns a L<WebService::MinFraud::Record::Country> object for the IP address.
This record represents the country where MaxMind believes the IP is located.

=head2 location

Returns a L<WebService::MinFraud::Record::Location> object for the IP address.

=head2 most_specific_subdivision

Returns a L<GeoIP2::Record::Subdivision> object which is the most specific
(smallest) subdivision.

If the response did not contain any subdivisions, this method returns a
L<GeoIP2::Record::Subdivision> object with no values.

=head2 postal

Returns a L<GeoIP2::Record::Postal> object representing postal code data for
the IP address.

=head2 registered_country

Returns a L<GeoIP2::Record::Country> object representing the registered country
data for the IP address. This record represents the country where the ISP has
registered a given IP block and may differ from the user's country.

=head2 represented_country

Returns a L<GeoIP2::Record::RepresentedCountry> object for the country
represented by the IP address. The represented country may differ from the
country returned by the C<< country >> method, for locations such as military
bases.

=head2 risk

Returns the risk associated with the IP address. The value ranges from 0.01 to
99. A higher value indicates a higher risk. The IP address risk is distinct
from the value returned by C<< risk_score >> methods of
L<WebService::MinFraud::Model::Insights> and
L<WebService::MinFraud::Model::Score> modules.

=head2 subdivisions

Returns an array of L<GeoIP2::Record::Subdivision> objects representing the
country divisions for the IP address. The number and type of subdivisions
varies by country, but a subdivision is typically a state, province, county, or
administrative region.

=head2 traits

Returns a L<GeoIP2::Record::Traits> object representing traits for the IP
address, such as autonomous system number (ASN).

=head1 PREDICATE METHODS

The following predicate methods are available, which return true if the related
data was present in the response body, false if otherwise:

=head2 has_country

=head2 has_location

=head2 has_risk
