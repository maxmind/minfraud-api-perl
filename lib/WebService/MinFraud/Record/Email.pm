=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class contains the data for the email associated with a transaction.

=head1 METHODS

This class provides the following methods:

=head2 first_seen

A date string (e.g. 2017-04-24) to identify the date an email address was first
seen by MaxMind. This is expressed using the ISO 8601 date format YYYY-MM-DD.

=head2 is_free

This property is true if MaxMind believes that this email is hosted by a free
email provider such as Gmail or Yahoo! Mail.

=head2 is_high_risk

This field is true if MaxMind believes that this email is likely to be used
for fraud. Note that this is also factored into the overall risk_score in the
response as well.
