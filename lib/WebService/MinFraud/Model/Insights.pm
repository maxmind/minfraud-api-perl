=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use 5.010;

  use WebService::MinFraud::Client;

  my $client = WebService::MinFraud::Client->new(
      user_id     => 42,
      license_key => 'abcdef123456',
  );

  my $request = { device => { ip_address => '24.24.24.24' } };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides a model for the data returned by the minFraud Insights web
service.

The Insights model class includes more data than the Score model class. See
the L<API
documentation|https://dev.maxmind.com/minfraud/>

=head2 billing_address

Returns a L<WebService::MinFraud::Record::BillingAddress> object representing
billing data for the transaction.

=head2 credit_card

Returns a L<WebService::MinFraud::Record::CreditCard> object representing
credit card data for the transaction.

=head2 device

Returns a L<WebService::MinFraud::Record::Device> object representing the
device that MaxMind believes is associated with the IP address passed in the
request.

=head2 funds_remaining

Returns the  I<approximate> US dollar value of the funds remaining on your
account. The fund calculation is near realtime so it may not be exact.

=head2 id

Returns a UUID that identifies the minFraud request. Please use this UUID in
bug reports or support requests to MaxMind so that we can easily identify a
particular request.

=head2 ip_address

Returns a L<WebService::MinFraud::Record::IPAddress> object representing IP
address data for the transaction. This object has the following methods:

=over 4

=item * C<< most_specific_subdivision >>

=item * C<< postal >>

=item * C<< registered_country >>

=item * C<< represented_country >>

=head2 queries_remaining

Returns the I<approximate> number of queries remaining for this service before
your account runs out of funds. The query counts are near realtime so they may
not be exact.

=head2 risk_score

Returns the risk score which is a number between 0.01 and 99. A higher score
indicates a higher risk of fraud.

=head2 shipping_address

Returns a L<WebService::MinFraud::Record::ShippingAddress> object representing
shipping data for the transaction.

=head2 warnings

Returns an ArrayRef of L<WebService::MinFraud::Record::Warning> objects. It is

web service.

=head1 PREDICATE METHODS

data was present in the response body, false if otherwise:

=head2 has_funds_remaining
