# SYNOPSIS

    use 5.010;

    use WebService::MinFraud::Client;

    # The Client object can be re-used across several requests.
    # Your MaxMind account_id and license_key are available at
    # https://www.maxmind.com/en/my_license_key
    my $client = WebService::MinFraud::Client->new(
        account_id  => 42,
        license_key => 'abcdef123456',
    );

    # For the fraud services, the request HashRef must contain a 'device' key, with a value that is a
    # HashRef containing an 'ip_address' key with a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address.
    # All other keys/values are optional; see other modules in minFraud Perl API
    # distribution for details.

    my $request = { device => { ip_address => '24.24.24.24' } };

    # Use the 'score', 'insights', or 'factors' client methods, depending on
    # the minFraud web service you are using.

    my $score = $client->score( $request );
    say $score->risk_score;

    my $insights = $client->insights( $request );
    say $insights->shipping_address->is_high_risk;

    my $factors = $client->factors( $request );
    say $factors->subscores->ip_tenure;

    # For the chargeback service, the request HashRef must contain an 'ip_address' key
    # with a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address.
    # All other keys/values are optional; see other modules in minFraud Perl API
    # distribution for details.

    $request = { ip_address => '24.24.24.24' };

    # Use the 'chargeback' method. The chargeback api does not return
    # any content from the server.

    my $chargeback = $client->chargeback( $request );
    if ($chargeback->isa('WebService::MinFraud::Model::Chargeback')) {
      say 'Successfully submitted chargeback';
    }
